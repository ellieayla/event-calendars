# Event Calendars

I'm interested in community events throughout the Greater Toronto & Hamilton Area.
Many organizations publish event information on their websites,
but not in form easily subscribed to.

This project periodically checks various websites and
exports an iCalendar (.ical / .ics) feed of upcoming events.

[Subscribe to them in your calendar app](https://jamesdoc.com/blog/2024/webcal/).

(This unifies several other projects from disparate git repositories.)
